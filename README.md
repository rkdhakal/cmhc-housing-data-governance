# 🏠 Canadian Housing Data Governance & Quality Framework

**An end-to-end data governance and data quality framework applied to Canadian housing data — demonstrating metadata cataloging, data lineage, stewardship, DQ rule execution, and quality scorecards.**

**Author:** Ram Krishna Dhakal  
**Tools:** Python · SQL · Collibra · Informatica IDMC  
**Dataset:** CMHC Housing Starts — Canada (2018–2023) | 10,800 records · 16 columns · 10 provinces  
**Live Dashboard:** [Interactive DQ Dashboard](https://cmhc-housing-data-governance-zaslgtkfkxi5n5agrz87th.streamlit.app)

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) publishes housing starts data that directly feeds into federal GDP reporting, mortgage insurance thresholds, affordable housing funding allocation, and provincial policy decisions. When this data has quality issues — missing values, invalid entries, inconsistent records across systems — the downstream consequences affect billions of dollars in policy decisions.

During my **Data Quality Analyst internship at CMHC (Sept–Dec 2025)**, I worked within their established data management program using **Informatica IDMC**, **Collibra**, and **Databricks SQL** to build and validate data quality rules, perform root cause analysis, document data assets in the enterprise catalog, and collaborate with data stewards across multiple domains.

**This project applies those same enterprise governance patterns** — metadata cataloging, CDE identification, data lineage, stewardship frameworks, DQ rule design, and quality scorecards — to a publicly available housing dataset, implemented using open-source tools (Python and SQL) instead of licensed enterprise platforms.

It is designed to demonstrate the **full governance lifecycle** as practiced in a real enterprise environment:

> **Source Data → Metadata Catalog → Data Lineage → Stewardship Framework → DQ Rules → Root Cause Analysis → Remediation → DQ Scorecard**

## 💡 Business Value Delivered

| What was done | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Identified **884 data quality exceptions** across 2 Critical Data Elements (751 unique records) | These are the exact records that would produce incorrect housing starts reports and policy metrics if left undetected |
| Built **15 executable DQ rules** with SQL logic across completeness, validity, uniqueness, accuracy, and consistency dimensions | Replicates the rule design and validation workflow used in Informatica IDMC — same dimensions, same severity levels, same escalation logic |
| Documented **complete 5-layer end-to-end lineage** from source permit offices to federal policy reports | Enables audit traceability — a regulator or data steward can trace any number in a published report back to its source system |
| Identified **6 Critical Data Elements** with business justification and column-level lineage | CDEs are the foundation of any governance program — knowing which fields matter most determines where you invest DQ effort |
| Established a **stewardship operating model** with RACI matrix and 4-level escalation framework | This is the people and process layer that most portfolio projects skip — governance isn't just rules, it's accountability |
| Produced **catalog artifacts compatible with Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud** | The CSV-based catalog, glossary, and stewardship files can be directly imported into enterprise governance platforms |
| Built an **interactive Streamlit DQ dashboard** with live scorecard, exception explorer, and custom dataset validation | Replicates the governance reporting and steward review workflow used in IDMC and Collibra |

## 🔑 Key Deliverables

### 1. Metadata Catalog (Collibra-style)

- **16 columns fully documented** with business name, data type, description, valid values, and governance metadata
- **6 Critical Data Elements (CDEs)** identified with business justification:
  - `HOUSING_STARTS` — Primary KPI; used in federal GDP reporting and funding allocation
  - `AVERAGE_PRICE_CAD` — Core affordability metric; drives CMHC mortgage insurance thresholds
  - `REF_DATE` — Core temporal dimension; required for all trend analysis
  - `GEO` — Primary geographic dimension; provincial policy reporting
  - `DWELLING_TYPE` — Housing policy segmentation
  - `INTENDED_MARKET` — Rental vs. ownership market analysis
- **Sensitivity classification** applied: Public / Internal / Confidential
- **Data ownership** mapped: CDO → Data Owner → Data Steward → Custodian

### 5. DQ Scorecard

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Overall DQ Score** | **99.45%** |
| Overall Grade | A |
| Total Records | 10,800 |
| Total Rules Executed | 15 |
| Rules PASS / WARN / FAIL | 9 / 6 / 0 |
| Total Rule Failures | 884 |
| Clean Records | 93.0% (751 unique records affected) |
| Completeness Score | 98.44% (B) |
| Validity Score | 99.56% (A) |
| Uniqueness Score | 100.00% (A) |
| Accuracy Score | 99.43% (A) |
| Consistency Score | 100.00% (A) |
| **CDEs Requiring Remediation** | HOUSING_STARTS, AVERAGE_PRICE_CAD |

### 6. Root Cause Analysis

The DQ engine doesn't just flag failures — it diagnoses them:

- **DQ-002 (Negative Housing Starts):** Traced to manual data entry errors in source municipal building permit systems. 307 records affected across all 10 provinces, with QC (37), AB (35), and NS (35) having the highest counts.
- **DQ-004 (Negative Average Price):** Traced to a sign-flip error during CPI adjustment in the CMHC Housing Price Survey pipeline. 117 records affected, distributed across all dwelling types.
- **DQ-001 & DQ-003 (NULL values):** 203 and 134 null records respectively — flagged for steward review and back-fill from source systems, not auto-remediated.

## 📝 Dataset Note

This project uses a **synthetic dataset** modelled after CMHC public housing starts data ([Statistics Canada Table 34-10-0143-01](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3410014301)):

- Same schema and value domains as the published dataset
- Realistic DQ issues (nulls, negative values, inconsistencies) introduced intentionally for governance demonstration
- Covers 10 Canadian provinces; territories (NT, YT, NU) are in the valid domain but not in the current dataset

## 🔮 What I'd Improve in a Production Environment

This project demonstrates governance patterns. In a real enterprise implementation, I would add:

- **Automated scheduling** — Run dq_engine.py on a monthly schedule via Airflow or Azure Data Factory, triggered when new CMHC data arrives, rather than executing manually against a static CSV
- **Live Collibra integration** — Push DQ scores, rule results, and exception counts directly into Collibra via REST API after each run, so the catalog reflects current data quality without manual CSV imports
- **DQ trend monitoring** — Append each scorecard run to a history table and plot scores over time in the dashboard, so stewards can see whether quality is improving, degrading, or stable across months
- **Incident management integration** — Route FAIL and WARN exceptions automatically into ServiceNow or Jira with rule ID, severity, CDE, and assigned steward — replacing the current manual escalation step with a tracked, SLA-bound workflow
